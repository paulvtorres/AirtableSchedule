How long you spent on the assignment:
I spent approximately 4 hours developing the timeline app, including designing the user interface, implementing lane management, and adding drag-and-drop functionality for event dates.

What you like about your implementation:
I am satisfied with the compact and clear layout, which dynamically arranges events into lanes based on their start and end dates. The zoom feature and synchronized scrolling between the timeline and event lanes make navigation intuitive. Drag-and-drop allows for easy adjustment of event dates while keeping the interface clean.

What you would change if you were going to do it again:
If I were to redo the project, I would enhance the visual distinction between overlapping events, possibly using color coding or patterns. I would also refine drag-and-drop behavior to snap events precisely to the day grid, improving accuracy and usability.

How you made your design decisions:
I prioritized simplicity, readability, and compactness. I reviewed common timeline interfaces, such as Airtable and Google Calendar, for inspiration, focusing on efficient use of space and clear alignment between events and the time axis. I chose Jetpack Compose for its flexibility in building responsive UIs and easy handling of gestures like drag-and-drop.

How you would test this if you had more time:
I would create automated UI tests to validate proper lane assignment, correct positioning of events, and accurate response to drag-and-drop and zoom interactions. Manual testing would also be performed to ensure smooth scrolling, alignment, and visual clarity across different screen sizes ands edit names of events.

Any special instructions on how to build/run your app:

Open the project in Android Studio.

Run the app on an emulator or physical device with Compose support.

The timeline supports zooming in/out via controls at the top and drag-and-drop to modify event start and end dates.

No external libraries are required beyond standard Jetpack Compose dependencies.
